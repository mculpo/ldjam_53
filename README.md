DeliveryBoy was inspired by two other popular games, Paperboy and Overcooked. Paperboy is a classic arcade game from the 1980s that tasks players with delivering newspapers while avoiding obstacles and delivering to the correct houses. Overcooked is a modern cooperative game where players work together to prepare and deliver food orders while navigating through various obstacles.
